# Notepad 82

This program lets you save text notes, which was never possible with the TI-82. It may have bugs, although none were noted by me. Please note that the filename feature is not being used yet. Future releases will have filenames included, and its own file system (hopefully). 

## History
I wrote this software for the TI-82 back when I was in high school, and was pleasantly surprised to find the source code on one of my backup DVDs. The version on GitHub today is what I labelled as Beta v1.0 (dated January 29, 2003) back then. This is thus an earlier version of what I ultimately published to ticalc.org on May 3rd, 2023, [Beta 1.1](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/286/28652.html), which is still accessible to this day. I'll update this repository when and if I find the source for Beta 1.1.

## Instructions 
Run the INSTALLER first!

NOTE: When you save a note (by pressing Y=) , it is only save to the temp. To save it for good, use FILEMAN and press save. Choose a slot, and then its saved.
