# Notepad 82

This program lets you save text notes, which was never possible with the TI-82. It may have bugs, although none were noted by me. 

## History
I wrote this software for the TI-82 back when I was in high school, and was pleasantly surprised to find the source code on one of my backup DVDs. The version on GitHub today is what I labelled as Beta v1.0 (dated January 29, 2003) back then. This is thus an earlier version of what I ultimately published to ticalc.org on May 3rd, 2023, [Beta 1.1](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/286/28652.html), which is still accessible to this day. I'll update this repository when and if I find the source for Beta 1.1.

## Instructions 
Run the INSTALLER first!

NOTE: When you save a note (by pressing Y=) , it is only save to the temp. To save it for good, use FILEMAN and press save. Choose a slot, and then its saved. 

Please note that the filename feature is not being used yet. And I wouldn't hold your breath for new updates since I haven't touched this code since 2003. ðŸ™‚
